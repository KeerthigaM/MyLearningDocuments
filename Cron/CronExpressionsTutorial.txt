CRON:
cron is a basic utility available on Unix-based systems or UNIX tool.
It enables users to schedule tasks to run periodically at a specified date/time.
And, it’s naturally a great tool for automating lots of process runs which otherwise would require human intervention.
so its scheduling capabilities are powerful and proven.

Cron runs as a daemon process – which means it only needs to be started once and it will keep running in the background. 
This process makes use of crontab to read the entries of the schedules and kicks off the tasks.


The CronTrigger class is based on the scheduling capabilities of cron.
CronTrigger uses “cron expressions”, which are able to create firing schedules 
such as: “At 8:00am every Monday through Friday” or “At 1:30am every last Friday of the month”.

A cron expression is a string comprised of 6 or 7 fields separated by white space.
Fields can contain any of the allowed values, 
along with various combinations of the allowed special characters for that field. 
The fields are as follows:


Field Name	Mandatory	Allowed Values		Allowed Special Characters
Seconds		YES		0-59			, - * /
Minutes		YES		0-59			, - * /
Hours		YES		0-23			, - * /
Day of month	YES		1-31			, - * ? / L W
Month		YES		1-12 or JAN-DEC		, - * /
Day of week	YES		1-7 or SUN-SAT		, - * ? / L #
Year		NO		empty, 1970-2099	, - * /

So cron expressions can be as simple as this: * * * * ? *
or more complex, like this: 0/5 14,18,3-39,52 * ? JAN,MAR,SEP MON-FRI 2002-2010

<second> <minute> <hour> <day-of-month> <month> <day-of-week> <year> <command>
From these, <year> field is optional.
Space id mandatory for every specification.Eg.. sec space minute space hour.

Cron Special Strings
In addition to the fields specified in the cron expression, 
there’s also support for some special, 
pre-defined values – which can be used instead of the fields.

@reboot – run once at the start-up
@yearly or @annualy – run once a year
@monthly – run once a month
@weekly – run once a week
@daily or @midnight – run once a day
@hourly – run hourly

Special characters
* (all values) 
- used to select all values within a field. For example, “*” in the minute field means “every minute”.

? (no specific value” or "any value)
- useful when you need to specify something in one of the two fields in which the character is allowed, but not the other.
it is utilized in the <day-of-month> and <day-of -week> fields to denote the arbitrary value – neglect the field value.
For example, if I want my trigger to fire on a particular day of the month (say, the 10th), 
but don’t care what day of the week that happens to be, 
I would put “10” in the day-of-month field, and “?” in the day-of-week field. 

– (range) 
– it is used to determine the value range or to specify ranges. 
For example, “10-11” in <hour> field means “10th and 11th hours”
For example, “10-12” in the hour field means “the hours 10, 11 and 12”.

, (values) 
– it is used to specify multiple values. 
For example, “MON, WED, FRI” in <day-of-week> field means on the days “Monday, Wednesday, and Friday”

/ (increments) 
– it is used to specify the incremental values. 
For example, “5/15” in the <minute> field, means at “5, 20, 35 and 50 minutes of an hour”
For example, “0/15” in the seconds field means “the seconds 0, 15, 30, and 45”.
You can also specify ‘/’ after the ‘’ character - in this case ‘’ is equivalent to having ‘0’ before the ‘/’.
For example, ‘1/3’ in the day-of-month field means “fire every 3 days starting on the first day of the month”.
Note the subtlety that “/35” does *not mean “every 35 minutes” 
it mean “every 35th minute of the hour, starting at minute zero” - or in other words the same as specifying ‘0,35’.

L (last) 
– it has different meanings when used in various fields. 
For example, the value “L” in the day-of-month field means “the last day of the month” 
	    -day 31 for January, day 28 for February on non-leap years. 
	     If used in the day-of-week field by itself, it simply means “7” or “SAT”. 
	     
	     But if used in the day-of-week field after another value, it means “the last x day of the month” 
	     For example, “6L” means “the last friday of the month”.
 
	     You can also specify an offset from the last day of the month, 
	     For example, “L-3” which would mean the third-to-last day of the calendar month. 
When using the ‘L’ option, it is important not to specify lists, or ranges of values, as you’ll get confusing/unexpected results.

W (weekday) 
- used to specify the weekday (Monday-Friday) nearest to a given day of the month.
For example, if we specify “15W” in the <day-of-month> field, 
	     the meaning is: “the nearest weekday to the 15th of the month”. 
             If the 15th is a Saturday, the trigger will fire on Friday the 14th. 
             If the 15th is a Sunday, the trigger will fire on Monday the 16th. 
   	     If the 15th is a Tuesday, then it will fire on Tuesday the 15th. 
	     If you specify “1W” in the <day-of-month> and if “1st” is Saturday, then the job will be triggered on “3rd” which is Monday, and it will not jump back to the previous month.
The ‘W’ character can only be specified when the day-of-month is a single day, not a range or list of days.

The 'L' and 'W' characters can also be combined in the day-of-month field.
'LW', which translates to "last weekday of the month"*.

# 
- used to specify the “N-th” occurrence of a weekday of the month,
For example, “6#3” in the day-of-week field means “the third Friday of the month” (day 6 = Friday and “#3” = the 3rd one in the month).
For example, “2#1” = the first Monday of the month and “4#5” = the fifth Wednesday of the month.
Note that if you specify “#5” and there is not 5 of the given day-of-week in the month, then no firing will occur that month.
The legal characters and the names of months and days of the week are not case sensitive. MON is the same as mon.
